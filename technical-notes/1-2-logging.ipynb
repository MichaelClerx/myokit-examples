    "   2. This can be done by logging in two separate logs and then joining them\n",
    "\n",
    "For case 1, it would be ideal to always log the initial and final step.\n",
    "For case 2 it would be better to log half-open intervals (so include t0 but not t1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use case 1 is very common.\n",
    "The most common version of use case 1 is a single cell simulation with variable steps, simulating exactly one beat.\n",
    "This means the step sizes at the end of the log become wide, so that the last step in a 1000ms simulation may be somewhere in the range 800-900ms.\n",

    "For variable logging, log full intervals except when appending.\n",
