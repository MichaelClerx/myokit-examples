    "\n",
    "Sets and dicts in Python are based on hash maps. To make objects useable as keys in a dict or items in a set, they need to implement a *hash function* that returns an **almost unique integer**. Look-ups in a set or dict start with a quick hash-based jump, followed by a \"proper\" check using `==`. As a result, the `__hash__` and `__eq__` methods of user-defined classes have [some restrictions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default implementations use `is`**.\n",
    "By default, `x.__eq__(y)` returns `x == y`, and `hash(x)` returns \"an appropriate value such that x == y implies both that x is y and hash(x) == hash(y)\". So if you leave hash and eq alone, your objects will be hashable, but with an \"is\" condition. In other words, `myokit.Number(1) in {myokit.Number(1)}` will return False because `id(myokit.Number(1)) != id(myokit.Number(1))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overriding eq removes default hash**.\n",
    "If you override `__eq__` but not `__hash__`, Python will automatically set `YourClass.__hash__ = None`, rendering your object unhashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overriding hash? Then do eq too**.\n",
    "If you override `__hash__`, you **must** also provide an appropriate `__eq__` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hashes must be immutable**.\n",
    "The value returned by an object's `__hash__` must stay the same during its lifetime. So in general you should only implement `__hash__` for immutable objects."
