    "- Because this is an implicit method, at each step a nonlinear system must be solved, for which the \"Newton iteration\" method (for dense systems) is chosen.\n",

    "Step sizes:\n",
    "- Instead of asking CVODES to integrate from some $t_\\text{min}$ to $t_\\text{max}$, Myokit uses the `CV_ONE_STEP` approach where CVODE just makes a single step of whatever length it determines is best.\n",

    "### Why CVODE(s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Models of single-cell electrophysiology have two properties that make CVODE a good choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are _stiff_, containing processes that occur at very different time scales. E.g. INa activates in 1-2ms, while concentrations in the same model drift very slowly.\n",
    "  Stiff problems are difficult to integrate, and usually require an _implicit ODE solver_.\n",
    "  Similarly, because the fast processes are only active for brief periods during the simulation, an adaptive step-size method is highly desirable.\n",
    "- Models of single cell electrophysiology commonly have an expensive-to-evaluate right-hand side (RHS).\n",
    "  This means that schemes requiring several RHS evaluations per step may not be competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "CVODE uses a variable-order (max 5) BDF integrator, which has [good stability properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_differentiation_formula), so that it can take large steps even for stiff problems.\n",
    "You can try this out: Run a simulation of a modern cell model in CVODES, and store every step.\n",
    "Next, use a forward-Euler method with the same steps.\n",
    "When I tried this the Euler method produced highly inaccurate results.\n",
    "CVODE uses a predictor-corrector method to estimate its error at each step, and choose an optimal step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second advantage of the BDF methods is that they are _multistep methods_.\n",
    "This means that, instead of requiring several iterations per time step, the method uses the derivatives calculated during previous iterations to build up a higher-order estimate.\n",
    "In [Clerx & Collins 2014](http://michaelclerx.com/publications/files/clerx-collins-2014-reducing-run-times-with-splines-authors-copy.pdf) we found that CVODE required only 1 or 2 RHS evaluations for most steps, although this occasionally rose dramatically, leading to an average number of evaluations per step of 1.6 to 6 for the models tested."

    "## Evaluating the Jacobian\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of letting CVODE(s) estimate the Jacobian, it is also possible to write a \"user-provided\" function that calculates it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Options for doing this automatically include automatic differentiation (this is included in Myokit but possibly won't be for long) and symbolic differentiation.\n",
    "[Cooper et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2014.00511) tried out a symbolically generated Jacobian in Chaste (which also uses CVODE) and found moderate speed-ups for most models.\n",
