# Models

This directory contains (partially) curated mmt implementations of several cardiac electrophysiology models (and a few non-cardiac ones).

Inclusion or non-inclusion in this list is based entirely on practical reasons, and does not reflect any kind of judgement on a model's merits.

The original authors of each model are indicated in the files, along with a link to the publication the models originally appeared in.
No statements or promises are made about the copyright or license associated with these files.
Limited copyright and licensing information is provided in some of the model files, but people wishing to use these models for commercial purposes should check with the original authors.
